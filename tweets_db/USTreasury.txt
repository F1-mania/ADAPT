We have a path for predictable and stable policy for the next two years... Now is the time to take a fresh look at opportunitiesÂ to invest
Does not matter whether it is Long Island City, Kansas City, Salt Lake City, strong infrastructure is essential for strong economic growth
Building our roads/railways/bridges/ports has been one bipartisan way to create jobs today &amp; lay foundation for future economic expansion
Lew: As our economy grows and our workers become more productive, this progress needs to reach the lives of more hardworking Americans.
Capacity to address concerns as long as both private &amp; public sectors commit to policies that strengthen workers, innovators, &amp; investmentÂ 
Secretary Lew: The ultimate test for all of us will be how inclusive tomorrowâs economy becomes and how widely our economic gains flow.
A breakthrough is happening somewhere in America... Â If we take right steps, our economy will be primed to take advantage of next innovation

Cordray @CFPB has already demonstrated an ironclad commitment to making sure American consumers are protected
Lew : I am pleased the Senate confirmed Rich Cordray @CFPB last night and that the distraction of delay will no longer impede progress
We will not let the pursuit of international consistency force us to lower our standards.
It is important to have clear &amp; consistent rules both in the United States and beyond our borders. Our financial system is global in nature
Lew: I will continue to push for swift completion of a rule that keeps faith with intent of [the Volcker Rule] and the Presidentâs vision
The last 60 days alone, we have witnessed one of the most active periods of implementation
Lew: By the end of this year, the core elements of the Dodd-Frank Act will be substantially in place.
Lew: Let there be no doubt: finishing the job of financial reform is critically important to me and this Administration.
#DoddFrank did not stifle economic growth.  It did not halt lending activity.  We are actually seeing just the opposite
3 years ago the President signed #DoddFrank into law. It created the strongest safeguards for consumers &amp; investors since Great Depression

Sec Geithner on @FaceTheNation: There's âno wayâ to raise enough revenue relative to our fiscal challenges just through limiting deductions
Sec Geithner on @FaceTheNation: âNo path to an agreementâ without Rs acknowledging rates need to go up on wealthiest Americans
Sec Geithner on @FaceTheNation: âThreat of defaultâ very damaging to the American people, ânot a responsible way to governâ
Sec Geithner on @meetthepress: âOnly thing standing in the wayâ of a deal is R refusal to accept rates have to go up on the wealthiest
Geithner @meetthepress: âNo way you can do this in a balanced way that restores fiscal responsibilityâ without tax rates on top 2% going up
Sec Geithner on @FaceTheNation: âVery good chanceâ for an agreement that protects 98% of Americans from a tax increase #my2k
Sec Geithner on @meetthepress: Going over #fiscalcliff b/c Rs won't raise rates on top 2% would subject avg Americans to âenormous damage.â
Sec Geithner on @ThisWeekABC: âNo reasonâ 98% of Americans should see taxes go up b/c some Rs want to block tax rate incrs for top 2% #my2K
Sec Geithner @ThisWeekABC: âThere's no surprise in this.  We've been proposing this for a very long time.  The president campaigned on it.â
Sec Geithner @ThisWeekABC: Admin debt limit proposal is to extend âan idea that Senator McConnell proposedâ last Summer http://t.co/ySzwbmqm
Sec Geithner on @ThisWeekABC: #BalancedPlan to reduce deficit will create âroom to invest in things to make America strongerâ
Sec Geithner on @ThisWeekABC: âWhat we're trying to do is to not just prevent a tax increase on 98% of Americansâ #my2k
Sec Geithner on the debt limit from @meetthepress: âExtend . . . the McConnell provision.â #McConnellProvision
Sec Geithner on Admin's debt limit proposal from @meetthepress: âIt was a Republican idea. And weâre suggesting they extend it.â
Sec Geithner on @meetthepress: âWe canât react to anything until we see the details of their proposalâ
Sec Geithner on @ThisWeekABC: Protecting Bush tax rates for wealthiest 2% would âcost a trillion dollars over 10 yearsâ
Sec Geithner on @ThisWeekABC: âBroad supportâ from the business community and from the American people for President's approach
Sec Geithner on @CNNsotu: âWhat we need to hear from [Rs] now is what do they think makes sense.â
Sec Geithner on @CNNsotu: âWe donât have a lot of time, we canât wait very long.â
Sec Geithner @FoxNewsSunday: If Rs recognize âwe cant afford to extend those tax rates [for top 2%] then we have the basis for an agreementâ
Sec Geithner @FoxNewsSunday: Only reason we'd go off the fiscal cliff is if Rs âwant to extend tax rates for the rich that we cant affordâ
Sec Geithner on @FoxNewsSunday: âDon't have that much timeâ; Rs should commit that taxes won't go up on 98% of Americans #my2K
Sec Geithner on @CNNsotu: âIf Republicans are not willing to let rates go back up . . . then there will not be an agreementâ
Sec Geithner on @FoxNewsSunday: Admin proposed ways to boost economy in fiscally responsible way, matched with spending savings
Sec Geithner on @CNNsotu: If Rs force higher rates on all Americans to protect rates for top 2% they'll âown the responsibilityâ #my2k
Sec Geithner on @CNNsotu: âFirst time in decadesâ Republicans acknowledging need for higher taxes to reduce deficit
Sec Geithner on @FoxNewsSunday: We've proposed to ârebuild the country's infrastructureâ; extend UI; help Americans refi their mortgages
Sec Geithner on @FoxNewsSunday: Rs for the âfirst time in two decadesâ acknowledge revenues must go up as part of #balancedplan
