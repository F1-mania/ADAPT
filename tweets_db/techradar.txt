So, to recap. Oculus Rift ships with an Xbox One controller, will work natively with Windows 10 and a new Oculus Touch concept was announced
Oculus touch announced - here's our story http://t.co/tzcFXP3Mat http://t.co/oR6Q5m9snc
Touch can detect a set of finger poses - including pointing, waving or giving a thumbs up
These are the 'half moon' prototypes. "Each has analogue thumbstick, two buttons and an analogue trigger" Haptics are also included.
This is super exciting. We can't wait to try out the Oculus Touch http://t.co/JziofN6YYj
Oculus Touch announced "To take VR to the next level" http://t.co/Z5Juq3HsPC

Eve Valkyrie "is the closest thing you're going to get to being a real space fighter ship pilot" http://t.co/k178SRcieR
Onto the content then: Jason Rubin takes to the stage.
The Rift will natively work with Windows 10. #OculusE3
Confirmation that we're going to see an Oculus Rift gamepad. And it's going to be an Xbox One controller!
The balance has been improved - which is a big deal. "You can put it on like a baseball cap"
Headphones are detachable - so you can use your favourite cans. The Rift is lightweight and comfortable, says Iribe.
External desk sensor "is invisible when you put it on your desk" (It isn't invisible)
Two OLED screens but "maybe not the high resolution that you really want" #OculusE3
"This is going to change everything," says Tim Coo...sorry Iribe. "Oculus Rift is going to bring the magic of presence."
"It was nothing short of absolute incredibleness," says Iribe. This isn't hyperbole people!!!!111oneoneone
If it wasn't for listening to other people/marketing dept's music before press conferences start we'd be culturally poorer don't you think?

Sounds like Apple is majorly appealing to smaller artists who feel like they'll be hard done-by on Spotify #WWDC15
Stream songs on iTunes on demand. Apple's got a 24-hour radio station. Then there's Connect, where artists can express themselves #WWDC15
Lots of vague talk, but we're not yet sure how it's better than Spotify and others #WWDC15
What do we want? A new iPod! When do we want it? Some time soon, like, in the next few months or whatever #WWDC15
Nah, just kidding. It's just Jimmy Iovine #WWDC15
"To tell you more about it, THE BEATLES!" #WWDC15
Apple Music! "The next chapter in music" #WWDC15
It's music time... which apparently means another montage #WWDC15
"We do have one more thing..." #WWDC15
SEE? We weren't lying #WWDC15 http://t.co/ER9Cl35Xov
WatchOS 2 developer beta available today. Available in the Fall for everyone. Will of course be free #WWDC15
You can reply to email yourself or use Siri to reply instead #WWDC15
Creating a watch face from photos is nice and easy. We still think having all your photos on the Watch looks a bit silly though #WWDC15
New Pokemon badges! We mean, err, achievements #WWDC15 http://t.co/KhwVweXAyG
Use different colors when drawing on the Watch. You can also get Siri to work just by holding the Watch up #WWDC15
"We realise some of you have more than 12 friends". Pffft, good one pal #WWDC15
New nightstand mode looks a'ight. The alarm is pretty neat. #WWDC15 http://t.co/diYakvXsTN
Apple just announced Time Travel #WWDC15 http://t.co/w8PtNAYcCG
#WWDC15 http://t.co/4iLcCnzQUO
Apple's made some nice time-lapse faces. But will they make time go faster too? #WWDC15
After a brief interlude we're onto watchOS 2. We'll get new watchfaces, including a lovely new Photo face #WWDC15
@BoyFromBuffalo TYPICAL ANDROID FANBOY TALK

Apple's pulling the cord with CarPlay. You'll be able to start using it with your iPhone in your pocket #WWDC15
Additional health metrics being added to HealthKit: UV exposure, hydration, reproductive health. #WWDC15
iOS 9 just 1.3GB to download and install. It was almost 5GB in iOS 8 #WWDC15
In iOS 9 you have a low-power mode, much like Android's. Can extend battery by up to three hours #WWDC15
You can also pin a video to a spot on the screen while you're using other apps #WWDC15 http://t.co/Dy65i7Kmgo
Yes, this is split-screen. You can further slide the app over so two apps are side by side, using half the screen each #WWDC15
Onto multitasking! In iOS 9, Slideover lets you slide a finger over to drag another app over from the side  #WWDC15 http://t.co/MYJfhnwK44
Onto iPad now. You can now put two fingers down on the screen keyboard and it becomes a trackpad. That's actually pretty handy #WWDC15

Siri getting a bit more like Google Now. Trying to be more predictive than reactive #WWDC15
Or "Remind me to take my coffee off the roof of the car when I get in". Siri will know when you're getting into the car #WWDC15
Siri gets a new UI in iOS 9. Ask it things like "Show me photos from Utah last August" #WWDC15
We're onto iOS 9 now, starting with Siri. Serves over 1 billion requests per week #WWDC15
El Capitan is available to all developers... today! Public beta in July, rolling out to everyone with free upgrade this fall #WWDC15
Fortnite from Epic Games. Epic says it's actually seen 70% reduction in CPU usage with metal #WWDC15

Performance improvements: 1.4x faster in app launching, 2x faster to get mail massages, opening a PDF in preview 4x as fast #WWDC15
Lots of cool things to do with split view in El Capitan... a hint of what's to come for the iPad? #WWDC15
Full-screen Mail is now easier to jump around in. A small improvement, but a welcome one http://t.co/SqbOnvTtXs #WWDC15
