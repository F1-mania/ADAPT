Graph Search is available as a limited beta at http://t.co/3y9gXtpg
If you search for something not in the graph, results will be from BIng.
Potential for doctor and restaurant recommendations. Find a dentist liked by your friends, or Indian food liked by your friends from India.
An example photo search using Facebook Graph Search, "Photos of my friends in Paris." http://t.co/uFhU0YMu
More example searches about interests:  TV shows liked by software engineers or languages my friends speak.
For people worried about privacy, you can only search for the content that people have shared with you.
Also handy for dating, with searches like "Friends of friends who are single men." Search can be refined by location, school, employer.
You can also use Graph Search to find new friends with queries like "People named Chris who are friends with Lars and went to Stanford."
Another use case: searching for a restaurant. You'll get social results (who has eaten there) as well as reviews.
Graph Search is in the early stages and focuses on photos, people, places and interests. Example search: "photos of my friends in 2009."
Graph Search is privacy aware, and it indexes content across Facebook so it can be searched quickly.
The company is announcing something called "Graph Search," which Zuckerberg emphasizes is not web search.
We're live at Facebook HQ, where Mark Zuckerberg is set to announce a new mystery product.
