@_anamichelleee great question! use 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of water. plunge after brewing for 4 minutes and enjoy :)
@NateAmerman sorry, to clarify - your options are short, tall, grande, venti and trenta :)
@NateAmerman nope, no limit!
@Charlotte_218 yup - gladly!
@xxsm01 why thank you! :)
@Zen_Ren awww yay! so glad you enjoyed it :)
@GoldenBella91 yes, if you bring in your own cup / tumbler you'll get a 10-cent discount - that offer is good every day!
@Lee_Silverstein They're actually going to be very similar! The difference is negligible.
@natblevins_ Here's a great recipe to make #PTL at home: http://t.co/MYr5HjnfZQ. And Passion Tango tea is 25% off until April 27. Enjoy!
@wind4dancer yup! u can swap out the milk chocolate sauce for our regular mocha sauce (dairy free) &amp; add marshmallow syrup, hold the WC.
@dakben 2 heaping tablespoons of whole beans will work!
@JadeMarieAvery not at this time but we would recommend a decaf Pike Place Roast, which is a medium roast.
@nattielight1017 we'd still recommend the 2 tablespoons for every 6 ounces of water. you could use a bolder blend, like Komodo Dragon!
@sarann_miran ouch! you could check your water - use clean, filtered cool water - and the k-cups expiration date.
@AleyDinesh it's best to check with your individual store. some stores do stop brewing bold after noon.
@ChadDulaney nope, same ratio works :)
@Milkman331 for 8 6-ounce cups with a 2-tablespoon coffee scoop, we recommend 1 coffee scoop per 6 ounces of water....so 8 scoops!
@dakben ground!
@augustsea123 ceramic!
@chefrachelit that's okay - we'd recommend figuring out how many ounces of water you need by using a measuring cup đ

@anthonyjeez we may! if you're making CB at home, we recommend Kenya, Ethiopia, or Espresso Blend. Or half Ethiopia, half Italian Roast :)
@Reedie1965 to each, their own :)

@BackInTheFray for a pour over, use a fine grind like granulated sugar. more here! http://t.co/SJVV6NQhUu
@beViri yes, it's available all day as a pour over or an Americano; we also brew decaf after noon.

@bibliojoan great question! another option if you're short on time is a decaf Americano, which is available all day.
@jnheinmiller peach green tea lemonade is baaaaack! đ
Not all coffee makers have the same serving size marks or scoops. We recommend using the ratio 6oz water to 2 TBSP coffee. #ProTip
@kylineweasley @frappuccino we really wanted to do something special for your big day :)
@ashleynodal thank you for all that you do! đ

@xoxmindy Keep it in the fridge for 18-24 hours, plunge and enjoy. (2 / 3)
@xoxmindy a few steps on how you can make it at home: in a coffee press, brew your coffee for 4 minutes, double strength. (1 / 3)
@Cody_J_Ellis Here's how to make iced coffee http://t.co/xvJTDSt854 &amp; you can buy our Classic syrup online: http://t.co/5d07bxm2Ly.
@trevorknee does that number even exist?
@Jr1321 We recommend both for different occasions. A coffee press is excellent for brewed coffee and K-Cups for flavored coffee.
@EmilyRodmell no, they are not.
@joshdn a simple or classic syrup might be better, so it dissolves better. classic is on sale online right now: http://t.co/LKifTxw7LT
@pgshpak that proportion is right - it's short by 2 ounces of water but will brew the best cup.
@MustafainB you could head milk on the stove and whisk vigorously, no boil. and use brewed coffee or VIA with it :)
@BaileyGes1994 one option - make sure you have the right grind - fine, like granulated sugar.
@Verona83 it's really based on personal preference. Paper filter will give you a cleaner cup. Gold/mesh filter will be a bit thicker.
@zacharydalzell we do not but we recommend purchasing one from bodum. they're also available on amazon.
@radkeyshadow you can make a classic syrup with one cup hot water (just off the boil) and a cup of sugar, like brown sugar.
@Modest_Violet yes, we had winners! https://t.co/UUpk1N42lD
