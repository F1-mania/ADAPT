The new 5.5-inch #Apple iPhone 6 Plus is here: http://t.co/YNPbFO9USn http://t.co/HAVdLMbonq
Apple Watch $349 and available early next year #appleevent
@Iaintheoracle donât like Apple, right?
Apple Watch requires iPhone to work. Thatâs expected but a bit of a shame. Works with iPhone 5 upwards tho  #AppleEvent
Apple's iPhone 6 gets official: http://t.co/au9v5MwgCX http://t.co/BFpn7zd6X7
Apple iPhone 6 vs Apple iPhone 5s: What's changed? http://t.co/15H1hP6HGW
Now in fitness demo waters. Thereâs an activity and health app for the part-time runners, or workout for the harder of core #appleevent
Starwood Hotels will let you check in &amp; open your room door with a waft of Apple Watch come spring. Come on Oyster card, please! #AppleEvent
WatchKit joins HealthKit and HomeKit in the Kit squad. Custom apps and widgets for developers #applewatch #appleevent
@BashyUK it's very thick. I'll feedback when I've had hands on with the Apple one but I was a bit disapponted in the 360
In middle of an in depth demo of Maps on it, looks very fluid but hard to tell how small it is when watching huge face on screen #Appleevent
Any excuse to listen to a bit of Coldplay, theyâre now controlling music with the watch. Much of the functionality is familiar #AppleEvent
@BashyUK the 360 is very big. Have you tried it?
Those judging Apple Watch on my pic, thatâs just one of them. There are two face sizes, three editions with six different straps #appleevent
This is a range of watches, not a one off product. The options are vast #Appleevent #applewatch
@rockyguru all the styling still at mo
Two different sizes of face. Three collections - Watch, Sport, Edition. The latter is 18 carat gold  #appleevent #applewatch
âMilanese loopâ - how often do you hear that of a smartwatch #Appleevent
Six different interchangeable straps. The watch is the main body only. Plastic, leather and stainless steel options #AppleEvent #applewatch
Charge with a circular MagSafe connector to bottom. Has heart rate monitor and all the usual jazz underneath #applewatch #Appleevent
New S1 chip used inside Apple Watch, seems to have much smaller footprint than other smart watches. Keen to see up close #AppleEvent
Flexible Retina display on Apple Watch is made from sapphire glass, not the iPhone 6 #AppleEvent
Zoom in or out using the dial, never covering the screen. Nice solution to a smartwatch conundrum #Appleevent #applewatch
@MHYM1N Really disagree. letâs see how big this is. Both of those are very large
Apple Watch will not just replicate iPhone functionality or touchscreen of Android Wear. Digital crown dial on side is input  #appleevent
Apple Watch #iwatch #apple http://t.co/xBeFRkovSb
Apple Watch looks really nice, has dress like straps as well as plastic that will work more for fitness  #AppleEvent #iwatch
Apple Watch it is http://t.co/blpP1np7Ha
Here we goâŚ   #Appleevent #iwatch
Oh and itâs one more thing timeâŚ Crowd goes batshit #appleevent
@gushie snap!
Apple Pay sounds neat but if your battery dies, you then presumably canât buy anything. Will add to iOS 8 in October, no UK yet #appleevent
Mmmm McDonalds. Iâll have an apple pie with Apple Pay please *gets coat* #AppleEvent
@GetTheCones Yep but Apple hasnât used it
Apple Pay is US only to start with AmEx, Visa, MasterCard. Rolling out acceptance in stores from McDonalds to Staples #appleevent
No need to cancel credit card if phonenicked, you shutdown the individual number given to your phone apparently #AppleEvent
To add a card you just take a photo of it. Number not stored remotely, only on phone #AppleEvent
Pay uses NFC and new Secure Element chip. Credit cards sit in Passbook #AppleEvent
Apple Pay it is. Bet that took a long meeting. Touch ID yourself with new goods #appleevent
Cue Payments video. That woman has a LOT of credit cards #Appleevent
âEntirely new category of serviceâ aaaaaand itâs about the wallet #AppleEvent
@lisaclairexx I imagine press release will go out after the event
Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon recording audio only new iPhone 6 ads #appleevent #iphone6
No UK prices yet people #AppleEvent #iphone6
@JonBonney appears so
@crawshaw69 nah they never do, they just give timings
6 Plus $299-$499 for same capacities. Ship September 19 as expected, preorder from 12th #AppleEvent #iphone6
IPhone 6 pricing starts at $199 for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB #appleevent #iphone6
@crawshaw69 battery life improved but as ever lets see
iOS 8 demo now, What a surprise - BA flight delayed on the Notifications #AppleEvent #iphone6
@FoodnFooty Camera can shoot slo mo like the last one but with far more frames, so much smoother
@crawshaw69 Yeah, they use their own âultra pixelâ term. Megapixel is just a measurement if size after all
OK the new slo mo is ridiculously cool, 240fps. #appleevent #iphone6
New camera lens moves from side to side and up and down for auto image stabilisation. Video shoots 1080p at 60fps #appleevent #iphone6
@crawshaw69 a lot of other tech in it. Megapixels not everything. But we'll see
New iSight cameras are 8MP with True Tone flash and a load of new tech &amp; sensors that sounds good but weâll have to try it out #AppleEvent
Wi-Fi Calling - combines VoLTE &amp; faster Wi-Fi so you can call over internet when cellular connection is bad, automatically #AppleEvent
New M8 motion co-processor, measures distance, elevation &amp; air pressure. Makes use of new Barometer sensor. Nike using in app #appleevent
Vain Glory looks good game. 60fps, smooth. both new phones better battery itâs claimed - 6 Plus noticeably more than the 6 #AppleEvent
@JustmeHilmi We're on the case, fear not fella!
Hearing the streaming is bad at home, will try and keep you all updated #AppleEvent
Super Evil Megacorp are on stage to show off Metalâs graphic capabilities. What, no Epic? #appleevent
New A8 chip in both, again as expected. 50% more energy efficient itâs suggested? We certainly hope so #appleevent
iOS 8 includes better scaler - shows apps resizing for all new screens without updates #appleevent
âReachabilityâ is our new favourite word #Appleevent
Very thin. 7.1mm on Plus compared to 7.6mm on 5S. Landscape display now a la iPad #appleevent
iPhone 6 4.7â and 6 Plus 5.5â. 401ppi on the Plus, over two million pixels. Itâs pixel time! #appleevent
Sorry iPhone 6 Plus, to spell it right. Both come with new "Retina HD" displays #AppleEvent http://t.co/teBd6P4IcI
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+. Two sizes as expected #AppleEvent
Itâs iPhone time. Protruding camera like the leaks said #AppleEvent
âA very key date for Appleâ says Cook. No updates, so much to announce weâre going straight in #AppleEvent
Tim Cook takes the stage to rapturous applause. Obvs. If youâre  not interested in the #AppleEvent, we apologise for the next hour or so
Annnnnd weâre off. Itâs intro video time #AppleEvent

Wi-fi at Sony conference defeated us. But a cracking keynote. Uncharted 4, No Man's Sky, GTA V on PS4 plus PS TV outside Japan at last #e3
Little Big Planet really is a joyous piece of work! #e3 #SonyE3
Four player co-op in LBP3. These new characters are also going to throw a massive curveball at would-be creators! #e3 #SonyE3
Swoop is another you new character... you know I'm starting to sound like a child giddy on e-numbers. #e3 #SonyE3
Toggle is a another new friend. He the biggest and strongest in the game. #e3 #SonyE3
Oddsock is a new friend for Sackboy in LBP3. Yes, you read that right. #e3 #SonyE3
Little Big Planet 3 is up! #e3 #SonyE3
Next up is Entwined. Reminds me of thatgamecompany's work. Looks really lovely! #e3 #SonyE3
Seems that The Order will be battling feral humanoid beasties! #e3 #SonyE3
And now it's on to The Order! From hi-tech to Steampunk! #e3 #SonyE3
And you will be able to buy a Destiny PS4 console. Me oh my! #e3 #SonyE3
Destiny Alpha coming to PlayStation #e3 #SonyE3
You'll be able to play Destiny first on PlayStation.
Andrew House in the house! #e3 #SonyE3
Lots of spaceshps, fighting and guns! Looks lovely too! #e3 #SonyE3
WHo sounds a lot like Tyrion Lannister from Game Of Thrones! #e3 #SonyE3
Oh look. A floating AI in a Bungie game! Woo! #e3 #SonyE3
And we're starting with Destiny! #e3 #SonyE3
All aboard the Sony Press Conference train! Choo Choo! #e3 #SonyE3
@iiBonKeRsS Me too! #e3 #UbiE3
@iiBonKeRsS Thought it might be. Looked very one shot one kill. Like the Rainbow Six of old! #e3 #UbiE3
Stay tuned for Sony's briefing later! #e3 #UbiE3
So - you guys looking forward to anything? #e3 #UbiE3
Mixture of new games and announced ones. New IP, new titles and Rainbow Six, baby! #e3 #UbiE3
ANd beep beep beep, that's all folks! There we go! #e3 #UbiE3
Rainbow Six: Siege everyone! #e3 #UbiE3
Good guys have the hostage and are leaving. #e3 #UbiE3
Hang on. Is this.. #e3 #UbiE3
Okay. house breached. Four against five now. #e3 #UbiE3
Okay so it looks like a SWAT team is about to come in hard into a well guarded house! #e3 #UbiE3
Guys are blocking exits and entrances. Hostage spotted. This looks intriguing. #e3 #UbiE3
Raven vs Rogue team. House in a suburb. What's going on? #e3 #UbiE3
You know, Ubisoft must drive EA mad. It basically has the model their competitor want. #e3 #UbiE3
Okay, Ubisoft. You closing this sucker down big? Here comes Yves! #e3 #UbiE3
Wow. And I thought The Division was hectic. #e3 #UbiE3
Wait. Is the dog narrating this? #e3 #UbiE3
A dog in a WW1 game. No. Not fair. #e3 #UbiE3
This looks like it's going to be heartbreaking. #e3 #UbiE3
From Just Dance to The Division. From Shape Up to Valiant Hearts. Anyone else getting whiplash? #e3 #UbiE3
Valiant Hearts up next. This is going to be interesting. Same engine as Rayman set in WW1. #e3 #UbiE3
Good bye Shape Up. Some people will be buying you. I won't. #e3 #UbiE3
I would have though this would get really annoying after a bit. #e3 #UbiE3
Interesting. Shape Up transforms a cardio exercise into a game where you're trying to beat the score of another player. #e3 #UbiE3
Fitness is boring. Yes, Charles. It bloody is. #e3 #UbiE3
So Shape Up is Your Shape for the new gen? #e3 #UbiE3
Your Shape? #e3 #UbiE3
Come Assassin's Creed: Unity, give us a release date! #e3 #UbiE3
Oof! Guillotine! #e3 #UbiE3
@vdjomb Can understand feeling robbed. But Desmond was Mr Bland from Blandtown, wasn't he?
It looks like the climbing mechanics have been tweaked slightly. I don't recall Ezio being this nimble. #e3 #UbiE3
Good thing everyone spoke English in France back then! Otherwise I'd not know what was going on here! #e3 #UbiE3
@vdjomb That's a lie, isn't it.
RT @_TheNebula_: @t3dotcom good save! I was searching!
Revolutionary Paris wasn't a very rosy place was it? #ACUnity #e3 #UbiE3
Ooooh, some actual gameplay. Here we go. #e3 #UbiE3
And no, no one misses Desmond. #e3 #UbiE3
"Are you ready to rule the world?" Yes. Next silly question? #e3 #UbiE3
Looks like you and your mates will be engaged in some stabby stabby action in Assassin's Creed: Unity. #e3 #UbiE3
Lovely cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the world by Lorde in Assassin's Creed: Unity trailer #e3 #UbiE3
RT @GadgetMichael: @t3dotcom Hell yeah! Can't wait for it's release.
Here come the Assassins. Once again, Unity was at Microsoft's keynote. Have you got something new for us, Ubisoft? #e3 #UbiE3
The Crew beta is coming! Go sign up! And it will be out on November 4th on Xbox One, PS4 and PC! Woop! #e3 #UbiE3
June 10th and 11th, tune in on Twitch to watch battles on The Crew! #e3 #UbiE3
"The Hill Climb Skill Was Born!" "Awesome!" #e3 #UbiE3
BTW - if you want to know what that song was it was Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion by Oliver Tank #e3 #UbiE3 You're welcome.
Absolutely beautiful trailer for The Crew there! #e3 #UbiE3
Are those engines I hear? Here comes The Crew! #e3 #UbiE3
In all seriousness, I'm super stoked for The Division. Anyone else? #e3 #UbiE3
This guy is clearly Aiden Pearce's cousin. Has the same voice. Maybe he smokes as many cigs a day. #e3 #UbiE3
The Division is possibly the bleakest world Ubisoft have created. #e3 #UbiE3
So here comes The Division. We've already checked it out at Xbox's Keynote. Is this gonna be new? #e3 #UbiE3
Wow. His face and tone really went sinister there, didn't it? #e3 #UbiE3
Just Dance to The Division? The audience just got whiplash! #e3 #UbiE3
She towers over developers! Huzzah! #e3 #UbiE3
In all seriousness, can you imagine a crowd at Glasto doing this? #e3 #UbiE3
Hey! They're not watching the screen on this! I call foul! They've prepared this earlier! #e3 #UbiE3
Connecting the world through dance? #e3 #UbiE3
Your phone is apparently going to be your Wii Mote. #e3 #UbiE3
Just Dance Now! Here we go! #e3 #UbiE3
Okay. It's kind of hard not to get caught up in Just Dance 2015's day glo energy. #e3 #UbiE3
Thank goodness. For a second I thought they were going to lead off Just Dance 2015 with Blurred Lines. That would've been bad. #e3 #UbiE3
Just Dance 2015 is coming. Will it be on the Wii U, I wonder? #e3 #UbiE3
Yes! We've played Watch Dogs! And it was ace! #e3 #UbiE3
Hey Aisha! We're excited too! #e3 #UbiE3
Yes, Dan does have the best voice at E3. #e3 #UbiE3
Major Far Cry 4 announcement tonight? Why not just announce it from the stage? #e3 #UbiE3
Nope Far Cry 4. Let's take a look at you! #e3 #UbiE3
Far Cry 3? #e3 #UbiE3
ooh now what have we here.. #e3 #UbiE3
Fix bayonets! #e3 #UbiE3
Hello gang! You join us just as Ubisoft's press conference begins. #e3 #UbiE3
Star Wars, Battlefield and Bruce Lee head up EA's E3 showcase: http://t.co/0tGULagujj #e3
That's your lot from EA. Nice finish putting the beta live, like, now. We love a bit of insta-action. See you later for Ubisoft  #e3
Battlefield Hardline beta launches today at http://t.co/DHRGlH8zRK on PC and PS4 #e3
Battlefield loves a good collapse in its gameplay demos. Buildings, boats, BRING THE CHAOS! #e3
Battlefield Hardline looks great fun. Bit Payday, bit GTA V, lots of exciting #e3
@AsandaLFC It's usually last week in September
Cops v crims setup had already leaked, but Hardline looks like a clever change for the series #e3
Battlefield Hardline in the house #e3
Corner flag physics! #e3
FIFA 15. More realistic, more camera angles, more emotions, more more more #e3
Lots of concept art and chat for Mirror's Edge, not a lot of actual gameplay. Seems a way off #e3
Mirror's Edge. Exciting #e3
"Big guys, axes, armour, skullsâŚ I like that a lot." A "badass bookish nerd" speaks! Dawngate incoming #e3
Did he just say "legion of boom"? Did I imagine that? Hope not #e3
OK, all of EA's sports games are basically like watching telly now #e3
Madden 15. More realistic, more camera angles, more emotions, more more more #e3
OK, a battleship just ploughed through the golf course. PGA Tour is, erm, changing #e3
"This is golfâŚ without limits!" What, no members shouting at you for taking too long on the green? Bliss #e3
No name yet from Criterion, but it's basically Extreme Sports: The Game. Looks interesting #e3
New IP. Helicopters, boats, jet skis, jumping out of planes - looks like a GoPro commercial. "Inspired by YouTube videos" #e3
Criterion GamesâŚ get to the chopper! #e3
NHL 15 is pretty much like watching telly now #e3
Hit the sarcastically slow organ: it's NHL time #e3
Bruce Lee! UFC! Together at last! #e3
"Where else can you see someone die of laughter?" Hmm. Sims 4 out September, if that's your thing #e3
And we're on to The Sims #e3
Mass Effect chattage! #e3
No one expects the Dragon Age: InquisitionâŚ #e3
Terrible gag. Game looks great #e3
All these dragons are starting to drag onâŚ ahem #e3
Dragons again! Dragons, dragons everywhere this E3. Dragon Age Inquisition again, we're assuming #e3
Someone's playing a cello! #e3
Speeder Bikes! #e3
EA's off! We're at Dice, and there's a Star Wars themeâŚ oh hello #e3
EA conference incoming. Donuts and table seating in full effect. Casual #e3
And that's all folks! #e3 #XboxE3 
Stay tuned for EA, Ubisoft and Sony later on! I'm off to get a coffee! Woot!
Yes - a montage of all that we've seen. And I think Xbox One has knocked it out of the park. Much better than last year. #e3 #XboxE3
Phil SPencer is back - and it looks like we'll be wrapping up! #e3 #xboxE3
And it's called Crackdown... prosaically enough #e3 #XboxE3
@CuriousGFP both the magazine editor and editor at large (games) are at E3
BEST NEWS EVER!!! Er, I mean, ahem. There appears to be a new Crackdown game. And it involves co-op play and knocking down buildings.
CRACKDOWN!! It's CRACKDOWN!! YES, YES, A THOUSAND TIMES YES! #e3 #xboxE3
Another new exclusive about to be announced. #e3 #xboxE3
It's called Scalebound. And it involves fighting massive monsters! #e3 #xboxE3 Yes, yes YES!
More dragons! Game of Thrones you have a lot to answer for #e3 #xboxe3
"Prepare to see action at a whole new scale." And this is the guy who made Bayonetta. #e3 #xboxE3
Hideki Kamiya and Platinum Games are in the building. Xbox One is getting an exclusive from Platinum. OMG!! #e3 #xboxE3
The action here is frenetic. And tactics are needed. This looks really really really good! #e3 #XboxE3
The plan to take down the bad guys quietly didn't work and now all hell is breaking loose. #e3 #xboxE3
Found a faction in the street. #e3 #XboxE3
quite chilling. even. #e3 #xboxE3
Division crew walking through the subway. Rendering an augmented reality showing the panic of 11 days earlier. Quiet chilling.#e3 #xboxE3
Ryan Barnard from Massive - and here comes Tom Clancy's The Division. #e3 #xboxE3
We're announcing... Phantom Dust. #e3 #xboxE3
Everyone here is yawning. I'm sure it's the jetlag. #e3 #XboxE3
Ken Lobb and Killer Instinct now. #e3 #xboxE3
Griffin didn't last long - The Witcher brings his head home in a bag. #e3 #xboxE3
Tracking a Griffin now. Looks like a pretty dangerous past time. #e3 #XboxE3
Combat in this one is absolutely brutal. People losing arms and legs here. #e3 #XboxE3
The game is showing the massive open world that CD Projeckt have created for their world. #e3 #xboxE3
SORRY! WItcher 3! Witcher 3 up next. Same thing about the gore fix. #e3 #XboxE3
The Witcher 2 is up next. If you missed Game Of Thrones last night, here's where you get your medieval gore fix! #e3 #xboxE3
The Rise of Tomb Raider. #e3 #xboxE3
Very atmospheric. Very chilling. Lara looks like she's gone full psycho. #e3 #xboxE3
NEW TOMB RAIDER #e3 #XboxE3
Have to say that the plethora of games is enthralling the crowd here. #e3 #xboxE3
Xbox is doing a PlayStation-esque indie-game dump. "Look! Look at the quantity!" Bloody Threes! on Xbox!? #e3 #xboxe3
Game is called Inside. #e3 #XboxE3
New game from PlayDead. It's a platformer. Where they seem to be tormenting a child. #e3 #XboxE3
New game from a col studio. See a field filled with rain.
So - here comes the 2015 portfolio. Get ready kids! #e3 #xboxE3
After The Counsellor and Prometheus, Ridley Scott isn't quite the bastion of quality he once was. But still Halo Halo Halo Halo #e3 #xboxe3
Everything we've seen will be on Xbox One by the end of the year. #e3 #xboxE3
Phil SPencer is back. #e3 #xboxE3
And Halo The Master Chief Collection will be available from November 11th. #e3 #XboxE3
Halo: Nightfall, a show from Ridley Scott will be included in The Master Chief Collection. As will the Halo 5 beta.
Over 100 multiplayer maps in Halo The Master Chief Collection. Also - running at 1080p and 60fps. #e3 #xboxE3
Yes! We can play a game exactly how we played it 10 years ago! This is the future!! #e3 #xboxe3
Halo 2 is getting the HD treatment. And it will have the original Halo 2 multiplayer. #e3 #XboxE3
Halo: The Master Chief Collection. This will contain Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3 and Halo 4. All on one disk. #e3 #xboxE3
Bringing this new Halo to Xbox One - 'isn't about making a game'. Er, I think you'll find it is. #e3 #xboxE3
Bonnie Ross from 343 is here. #e3 #xboxE3
Master Chief is flying through space. And Keith David's rumbling voice is giving me goosebumps. #e3 #xboxE3
"Oris and The Blind Forest". Or "we can do beautiful, quirky indie games too, y'know?" #e3 #xboxe3
Strap in kids! Here comes Halo!!! #e3 #XboxE3
It's called Ori and The Blind Forest. Looks utterly enchanting. #e3 #XboxE3
Conker was certainly a complex character we felt needed further exploration narratively #e3 #xboxe3
Dark fantasy. Looks like Rayman by way of Fern Gulley #e3 #xboxE3
Something new from Moon Studios is being shown. #e3 #xboxE3
Project Spark has Conker in it. If that does anything for you. #e3 #xboxE3
Kinect was pretty integral to Project Spark last time we saw it. Wonder if it is nowâŚ #e3 #xboxe3
I think that Project Spark is up next. #e3 #XboxE3
Not a bad showing that. Fable Legends Multiplayer beta comes this autumn. #e3 #XboxE3
Fable Legends = Fable does Dungeon Master, effectively #e3
The villain is essentially a God that controls all of the evil creatures and makes life hell for the players. #e3 #XboxE3
Apparently you don't have to play as heroes - you can play as the villain if you like #e3 #xboxE3
The heroes are off to raid some ruins for an artefact. Lots of slashy swordplay and magic. #e3 #xboxE3
Down to Albion we go. Where you can now team up with other heroes. #e3 #XboxE3
Fable Legends up next. #e3 #xboxE3
Harmonix up next. Fantasia Music Evolved. And Dance Central Spotlight will be a download only title this September. #e3 #xboxE3
Dead Rising 3 gets Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon 'retro-funny' DLC. Looks retro and vaguely funny #e3
New DLC on Dead Rising 3 allows you to cosplay in the zombie apocalypse. #e3 #xboxE3
And we're back. Sunset Overdrive actually looks quite properly special. #e3 #xboxE3
Real Tony Hawk vibe on Sunset Overdrive too. So much colour! So much zany action! Out October 28 #e3
Sunset Overdrive. Borderlands meets Dead Rising meets Jet Set Radio, with a self-aware streak. Like it #e3
Dragon Age Inquisition out October 7. Dragony. The world likes dragons #e3
AC Unity showing four-player campaign multiplayer. Interesting to see how your mates will ruin your surprise attacks but looks cool #e3
Assassin's Creed Unity crowds look incredible. It's like a Les Mis simulator #e3
Ok, Evolve looks ace. In fact, we've played it, and it is #e3
Forza Forza Forza Forza. Beautiful cars, "dramatic" weather, clubs that we don't known anyone who uses #e3
What, no Kevin Spacey? Not even on conference call a la Dr Dre? Pffft #e3
@jashill71 Wahey!
