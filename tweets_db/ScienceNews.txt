Stern: We call the Pluto system a double planet because the balance point is between Pluto and Charon. #Plutoflyby http://t.co/iKhbNpmFxy
Data are confirming that Pluto has a massive rock core surrounded by icy shell. But does it have an ocean? Not sure. #PlutoFlyby
New Horizons helped pinpoint the radius of Pluto to 1185-1187 kilometers. Much narrower range than we knew before. #PlutoFlyby
Temperature on Pluto: 38 kelvin, or -380 degrees F #Plutoflyby

RT @alexwitze: Leo Enright calls flybys “science at the speed of journalism.”
Moore: Wind streaks, fine particles falling out of atmosphere, possibly. #plutoflyby http://t.co/R79nNdZvKg
Moore: Least crazy idea, still working on, dark stains composition, higher hydrocarbons. #plutoflyby
Bagenal: Not yet measured Pluto's atmosphere's escape. Expect it to be escaping. Pretty sure it's happening. Will by August. #plutoflyby
Stern: No data on Charon's atmosphere yet. Probably will have info on Sunday. #plutoflyby
More closeups. Cool one of frozen plains in the heart of Pluto's 'heart' https://t.co/QlSUV9JZyP #plutoflyby
Moore: Large polygons on Pluto, similar to high latitudes of Mars. Pluto's from convection, but could be contraction like Mars #plutoflyby
Moore: Clarifying, not seen plumes on Pluto yet. Hints that they could be there. Images will be hard to compare Pluto w/ Triton. #plutoflyby
Stern: Interested in volatiles moving around #Pluto. Can they bury structures or cover them so we see different ones over time. #plutoflyby
Randy Gladstone: No good measure yet of lower atmosphere, compressed layer, winds few m/s, could loft particles off surface. #plutoflyby
Amazing animation of closeups from #plutoflyby. Eye candy of icy mountains and plains. https://t.co/LjlSsZ6rlF

Moore: Pure coincidence, fates of space exploration, interesting places on Pluto in line with high-res imagers. #plutoflyby
Moore: Pitted surfaces on Earth from erosion from sun. On Pluto must be from sublimation, switch from solid to gas. #plutoflyby
Moore: Surface of Pluto, segments 12-20 miles across, bordered by shallow troughs. Hills close by. #plutoflyby http://t.co/unx6PPshlY

Bagenal: 500 tons/hr of material may be escaping from Pluto. Mars, it's 1 ton/hr. Over ~4.5 by, huge mountain of ice removed #plutoflyby
Bagenal: Interaction of Pluto's nitrogen atmosphere and solar wind, ionizing nitrogen, so behind Pluto may be an ion tail. #plutoflyby
Fran Bagenal, explains: Know atmosphere is nitrogen. Pluto's gravity weak, so leaking off, may interact with solar wind. #plutoflyby
Gladstone: Heavy hydrocarbons near surface. Nitrogen atmosphere, escapes into space. #plutoflyby
Next up, Randy Gladstone, mission scientist: Atmosphere is symmetric. More stagnant, ruling out models of what's happening. #plutoflyby
