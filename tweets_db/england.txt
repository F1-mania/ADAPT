Roy Hodgson and @WayneRooney have finished speaking to the press here at Stadion Stozice - they now head out for training...
.@WayneRooney: The training has been good, we're focused and ready for the game tomorrow night
.@WayneRooney: First and foremost I want to help the team do well. If personal achievements come with that then it would be great.
.@WayneRooney: The game last week was disappointing, but we have to move on. We are fully focused on tomorrow and getting the three points
Roy: Hopefully in the coming year some of the U21s players will emerge to become senior players
Roy: We're looking forward to watching the U21s, we think they will do very well and myself and Ray Lewington will be at all the games.
Roy: When you have a team as young as we have, everything is there to be improved. We need the experiences and challenges of the next year.
Roy: Self-assessments are not the best, but there have been a lot of changes since Manaus a year ago, I believe this is an exciting team.
Roy: It's rare before Qualifiers we announce the team. We like to keep one or two things to ourselves. I'm not prepared to give any hints.
Roy: Our preparation schedule has followed the same pattern as it always does. I don't know where talk of extra training has come from.
Roy: All 23 players are here, fit and available to play. We're training here at the ground so the players can try the pitch before tomorrow.
