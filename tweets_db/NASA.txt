@Mrhappypenguin Every surface in the solar system is covered in craters except Europa &amp; Earth. Something erases the craters.
@BSharp6669 Yes.
@delaquax We think the ocean is billions of years old. We hope this mission is a prelude to more exploration.
@azecos No. It will help us answer the big question - is Europa habitable?
@Amazing_Factzz The mission does not yet have a name.
@HamburgGary Yes. That's what we think. Follow along as this mission explores!
@adamkabam We see evidence for lots of geological activity. Hoping to get better data with this mission.
@DJedi13 We're figuring out if the ocean under the ice crust is habitable.
@Balmich If we orbit Europa, the radiation kills the spacecraft very quickly. A fly-by mission lasts longer &amp; returns more science.
@Jackiegoordial Possibly. We're hoping to answer the big question - is Europa habitable?
@deepak88S Scientists have been working on that for years and publish regularly.
@Sceppie We are far away from being able to do that. This mission will tell us how thick ice crust is. Then we'll know what we're up against
@vincesmith_bkpr Thanks for the great question. We'll have to think about that.
@Cobear2 It is expected to launch in the 2020s.
@LadyBug394 This mission is not intended to find life but rather answer the question: Is Europa habitable?
@Jackapedia_ Some of the current guesses: Organics, magnesium sulfate, table salt &amp; many others. Follow along with the mission as we explore
@astro_bloke We're a long way from that, but yes, the radiation will cause problems, even for this Europa mission.
@SjoerdSjoerdens The payload gets ~120kg and when we fly-by Europa, every instrument will be turned on to collect data.
@thebgp1 Solar panels will power the Europa mission.
@RealPaulMartin We're not landing but hoping to explore this icy world.
@cmurrphy Money can accelerate development to a certain extent.
@SjoerdSjoerdens The closest fly-by will be 25 km about the surface of Europa.
@TildalWave We have not yet considered that.
@Azure_Eyes33 Hopefully. Every mission NASA does generates new questions that we hope power the future of solar system exploration.
@DJedi13 Not life as we know it.
@NASA_Engr_Brad Every instrument is needed to pursue the big question-is Europa habitable?-but yes, some instruments are more critical.
@jtuttlekeane Yes
@AutisticCosplay We have 2 instruments that will measure Jupiter's magnetic field. This is crucial to understanding Europa's ocean.
@Jackiegoordial It's been considered in the past and has not been reconsidered lately.
@icewinddale1 The big concern is the radiation levels around Europa.
@Jackiegoordial Both places are fascinating to study and have the potential to have or had an environment conducive to harboring life.
@TimKamvakJKT48 Landing is very, very hard. We need to first gather data on what the surface looks like to better inform future efforts.
@SweeneyKurt All 9 instruments are ~120kg.
@SETIgal1124 Juno does not get near Europa and will not be able to assist this mission to Europa.
@Kommatiazo If you orbit Europa permanently, the radiation will cause a short lifespan for the mission.
@A_SPACE_PARTY It will have a controlled collision with Ganymede for planetary protection reasons.
@bjorn_jons It has more filters &amp; steering. Plus, the resolution is higher &amp; it's optimized to work in a higher radiation environment

Recap: #ISS crew inside Russian segment after a coolant pressure alarm. No signs of a leak. Controllers are assessing. 11 a.m. EST TV update
Update: #Exp42 crew informed by controllers that it's starting to look like a false indication, either a faulty sensor or computer relay.
#ISS flight controllers are assessing systems on board the space station. We'll update as new information becomes available.
Again, the #ISS crew is safe inside the Russian segment after an alarm indicated a coolant pressure spike. No ammonia leak confirmed.
About 7:50 a.m. EST: A live #NASA TV update on the situation aboard #ISS. Watch http://t.co/6XtjOi1yJo
Following safety procedures, the #ISS crew was directed to isolate themselves in the Russian segment while the teams evaluate the situation.
#ISS flight controllers are not sure if the alarm was triggered by a pressure spike, a faulty sensor, or a problem in a computer relay box.
The #Exp42 crew members are safe inside the Russian segment of the #ISS following an alarm in the U.S. segment at about 4 a.m. EST.
Crew is following safety procedures while assessments continue. Monitor #NASA TV and http://t.co/V3cHlJRrAm for updates.
#NASA TV #ISS update in about 20 minutes. Crew is safe. No ammonia leak confirmed. Crew responded to coolant loop pressure increases.
