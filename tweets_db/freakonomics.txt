.@DaniSpasm Hey, nice try. Statute of limitations isn't up yet.
.@lcaller I have no idea why it's not out there yet ... It's always simultaneous here ... sorry #OutOfMyControl
.@electronluv If I had to pick desert-island discs, I'd say Exile on Main Street and Goldberg Variations, the later Gould version
.@jordanlong20 Nah.
.@StephenGHubbard We always tell ourselves we aren't making a bit of difference but people write all the time with evidence to contrary :-)
.@nickhnatiw We get better access to interviewees b/c of our status which, as a writer, is a huge huge plus. #ScrappedForYears
.@DunCowFC @BWaard Holy cow (literally), yes! So sorry! @DunCowFC is my *very* favorite football club (and we sponsor them!)
.@EmmetONealIII @BWaard This trope is so tired ...
.@ChadAChavez No, should I? I also don't repair cars but I drive ok.
.@Jurie_S @WNYC app ... then BG (backgammon) NJ ... then Twitter ...
.@HowdyHowdyBoss There are four books: Freakonomics, SuperFreakonomics (plus an illustrated ed.), Think Like a Freak, and When to Rob a Bank
.@pablovazig Yeah, like Australia, right? That's an interesting option ...
.@Kayarsees Hi Asheville! Is the great bookstore (Malaprop's?) still there? Hey bikers: Blue Ridge Parkway is best motorcycle route ever!
.@DrewTZ Did you see what Marco Rubio said the other day about this? I was intrigued, we are trying to get an intvw. with him
.@Donnainva Depends what the value (and/or "shadow value") of your time is ...
.@ITMEDENNY We put out roughly 40 new eps./year, so we do *almost* one a week. As for signed copy ... um, no, sorry ... am lazy
.@Ladislaz Hey, that's fine: "Hello" is its own sort of question, don't you think? :-)
.@MichaelEPfeffer Sure! But not from me.
.@vanitytoad Uh-oh, you figured us out!
.@findlad Will put this in the hopper. We did once write about relative risk of motorcycle vs. horse riding. (Look it up)
.@acerocolla Just had a blast in L.A. with my daughter (her first trip to Cali.). I like Boston a lot, also SF. Seattle too. Asheville, NC.
.@Debbie4PSU I think plastic grocery bags are about 1/10000th the problem that some people think they are ... Convenient symbol though
.@hyer_t Probably 60-70% of podcast ideas end up getting killed/abandoned/drowned/folded into something else ...
.@GregEschbacher Such an interesting question b/c theoretically the $$$ wipes out the "donating" force ...
.@PeteBusche (2/2) There is also a new, top-secret *daily* podcast potentially on the horizon (I think/hope) ...
.@PeteBusche Podcast is strong and getting stronger. Also planning to start a new quiz/chat show, "Tell Me Something I Don't Know." (1/2)
.@thefinktank Long story. We did a podcast about it a while back ("Is Twitter a Two-Way Street"?).

.@MaxwellJohn I like beer when I am really thirsty. But I love Scotch (@Laphroaig whenever possible) almost always. (1/2)
.@Donnainva Great question! Or, let me rephrase: that's a question I have long asked self. NYC real estate is skewed so much from exemptions
.@wheatonbrando Hard to say. We are working hard but we are also slow :-)
.@MaorCohen Somewhere between 2 (which is how many I have) and 8 (which is how many my parents had). #MyopicWorldview
.@ivonnatinkle Honestly, not many. I sample some here and there but I like to keep things original/not derivative.
.@ZachRozos Hard to answer fast but I just saw Amy Winehouse doc and was devastated by sadness and talent too. All-time fave: Rolling Stones
.@AronShaviv Hmm, I don't think you've read what we've written about voting, have you? Don't mean to by a cynic but voting isn't so rational
.@SporadicInsight Love this question ... But dang, can't think of anything in Twitter-appropriate time ... Sorry, SJD
.@bjmay Good q. but sorry, I know less than zero about that (which doesn't stop everybody else from prognosticating of course :-)
.@ZachRozos I think 23 or so, although I felt a lot older then :-). I still miss rock-and-roll but I believe I made the right decision.
.@EF110Econ Don't pretend to know more than you know and don't pretend you can predict the future. Instead: experiment, hustle, be humble
.@esyfrett I first got into econ via behavioralists like Kahneman/Tversky and @R_Thaler. Met Levitt only when I wrote about him for NYT ...
.@BWaard .... football (aka soccer). We support Barcelona (the treble this year) and NYC-FC but follow and watch many others (2/2)
.@BWaard Growing up it was baseball. Then for many years the NFL and the Steelers. But my son Solomon has converted me to football (1/2)
