More Qs? Ask @natrobe. 
Thanks for joining us!
ICYMI, here's our list of the top-selling authors in 2015: http://t.co/aN0jQ7Yh3i #AskForbes
.@kdngbale Seems to be. Few single nonfiction books build the following that series enjoy, hence lower earnings for their writers #AskForbes
RT @kdngbale: @natrobe @Forbes fiction writers flood the list of top earners. Does this mean nonfiction is less lucrative? #AskForbes
.@francesbridges Mostly royalties. Top-earning authors make comparatively little from selling the movie rights to their books. #AskForbes
RT @francesbridges: @Forbes @natrobe #AskForbes are the salaries purely book advances &amp; royalties, or is the majority from films?
.@KvnXYZ Rick Riordan and Jeff Kinney made far more from paperbacks than ebooks this year. #AskForbes
.@KvnXYZ Children's book authors still make most of their money in print. #AskForbes
RT @KvnXYZ: @Forbes Are childrens book authors still making revenue on hardcover books? Or are children's books better off in tech? #AskForâŚ
.@samsharf Most authors on our list benefit from hefty backlists. #AskForbes
.@samsharf  Very few single titles sell above 1M copies a year, which is not enough to earn the author $$$ #AskForbes
.@samsharf No. Book sales are not what they used to be #AskForbes
RT @samsharf: #AskForbes Book series seem to dominate, is it possible for a one hit wonder to catapult an author onto the list?
.@_halah Adults ages 30-44 account for 28% of YA book sales. #AskForbes
.@_halah Most recent figures (2012) suggest 55% of YA books are bought by people age 18+ #AskForbes
.@_halah Not just teens, that's for sure. #AskForbes
RT @_halah: We call it "young adult" but do we know more about who is reading the genre today? #askforbes @natrobe
.@1importedfrmDet The vast majority of books acquired by publishers come to them through agents. #AskForbes
.@1importedfrmDet Then try to get yourself an agent who will do the legwork for you. #AskForbes
.@1importedfrmDet Start by researching the agents and publishers who print the genre you write. #AskForbes
RT @1importedfrmDet: What are some of the best ways to get your book out to editors? #AskForbes
.@Katkling Plus, plot-driven books make better movies, which can help shift copies #AskForbes
.@Katkling I'd love to say beautiful prose (just look at Knausgaard!) but good storylines win sales. #AskForbes
RT @Katkling: @Forbes @natrobe For today's readers, what's more important: good prose or an interesting storyline? #AskForbes
.@Clare_OC She's a one-off at the level of success she's achieved, but there's still money in fan-fiction #AskForbes
.@Clare_OC Twilight fan fiction has sold especially well (the Gabriel Trilogy: 850k+; Beautiful Bastard 1M+). #AskForbes
.@Clare_OC I'd like to think originality wins, but sales suggest fan fiction is here to stay. #AskForbes
RT @Clare_OC: @Forbes @natrobe #AskForbes Do you think the continued success of EL James shows fanfic is still a viable route to $$$? Or isâŚ
.@swolgon  I wrote about how books dominate the box office here http://t.co/XJbx3KjVZJ #AskForbes
.@swolgon YA fiction. 17 of the 25 highest-grossing book-movies started as YA novels. #AskForbes
RT @swolgon: @Forbes Which book genres are most easily adaptable into movies? #AskForbes
See the full list of this year's top-earning authors here: http://t.co/aN0jQ7Yh3i #AskForbes
.@abebrown716 But if "Watchman" continues to sell like hotcakes, especially in hardback, she could make it. #AskForbes
.@abebrown716 She earns ~$2.5M a year from "To Kill A Mockingbird Earnings" which alone is not enough for our $10M cut off #AskForbes
.@abebrown716 We might: depends how "Go Set a Watchman" performs. #AskForbes
MT @abebrown716 Why won't we see Harper Lee on next year's list? #AskForbes
.@TheAlexKnapp Everyone loves a good bildungsroman story! #AskForbes
.@TheAlexKnapp It has a fanbase broader than teens: research suggests 55% of YA books are bought by folks 18+. #AskForbes
.@TheAlexKnapp I think we're going to see YA stick around. #AskForbes
MT @TheAlexKnapp YA books like Hunger Games seem to dominate right now - do you think that will go on, or will the bubble pop? #AskForbes
.@CombestCharles  Consider trying to write a novel in one of those genres (2/2) #AskForbes
.@CombestCharles The best-performing genres for high-earning authors tend to be YA, romance &amp; crime. (1/2)  #AskForbes

RT @EmilyCanal: @Forbes  What can average people do to help fight online harassment? Or what should you do if you're harassed? #AskForbes
.@annabelnlau I.e., some platforms don't need a user chat at allâso make it opt-in only, like the game League of Legends has done #AskForbes

You should start the process of building a debt-free plan today. Like any type of disease, the longer you wait the worse it gets. #AskForbes
If you are in credit card debt, waiting to build a plan to get out of debt costs you. #AskForbes
.@_iGerman Length of credit history plays a big role in your score - so it is literally the sooner the better #AskForbes
So long as you are able to handle a credit card responsibly, you should open one as soon as you can and use it responsibly. #AskForbes
RT @_iGerman: @Forbes When is the best time in someone's life to get a credit card?  #AskForbes
.@Jason_Villegas Also why some people who revolve can have a higher score than full payers. Doesn't always make sense! #AskForbes
.@Jason_Villegas That is why everyone should pay attention to utilization. #AskForbes
.@Jason_Villegas  It only looks at your total statement balance, and then compare that statement balance to your available credit #AskForbes
.@Jason_Villegas The impact on your score depends. It can't tell the difference between someone who pays in full or revolves. #AskForbes
.@Jason_Villegas You are a revolver, which means you pay interest on the balance. #AskForbes
.@Jason_Villegas Not paying off your balance in full every month will cost you a lot of money. #AskForbes
RT @Jason_Villegas: @Forbes Does it hurt your credit score not being able to pay off in full every month? #AskForbes
.@jspierscheney Your goal is to lower the interest rate you are paying - not defend your credit score for 10 points. #AskForbes
.@jspierscheney In debt &amp; looking for a lower interest rate? Don't be afraid to apply for a balance transfer or personal loan #AskForbes
.@jspierscheney If you are looking to apply for a mortgage or auto loan, I recommend an application freeze for 6 months. #AskForbes
.@jspierscheney If you shop for a personal loan, most of the marketplace lenders will prequalify you without hurting your score #AskForbes
.@jspierscheney For mortgages, auto loans and student loans, FICO will treat all inquiries in a 30 day period as 1 inquiry #AskForbes
.@jspierscheney On average, an inquiry can take 10-20 points off your score. There are some exceptions #AsKForbes
.@jspierscheney Every credit inquiry will have an impact on your score. #AskForbes
RT @jspierscheney: @Forbes how many credit inquiries can I do per year without hurting my credit score? #askforbes
.@jmsteiner8 Then you have positive information feeding the credit bureau without costing you anything. #AskForbes
.@jmsteiner8 If you want maximum points, just make 1 purchase a month on the card. Even a pack of gum. #AskForbes
.@jmsteiner8 In other words, the fact that you aren't using the credit card shows self-discipline, which is a good thing #AskForbes
.@jmsteiner8 The total available credit would be used for calculating your overall utilization. #AskForbes
.@jmsteiner8 The date that the card was opened would remain in your credit file (showing the length of your credit history) #AskForbes
RT @jmsteiner8: @Forbes #AskForbes if I had an old card and got the balance to $0 but didn't cancel the card. It sits unused. How does thatâŚ
Utilization and total debt makes up about 30% of your FICO score. #AskForbes
.@AyyyJamieParker Having more available credit can be a good thing, so long as you don't use it! #AskForbes
.@AyyyJamieParker If they are increasing your limit, that's a good sign - it likely means you have a good score to start with #AskForbes
RT @AyyyJamieParker: @Forbes If my credit card company ups my limit how good is that for my credit score? Is it a noticeable change? #AskfoâŚ
.@WackTeenGuy By making 1 purchase, you keep utilization low. By paying on time, you get positive benefit on your credit report #AskForbes
.@WackTeenGuy Although don't worry about "perfect" credit score. Keep it above 750 and life will be good. #AskForbes
.@WackTeenGuy Yes! That is a great way to do it! #AskForbes

.@3countylaugh 2. It is basically a free line of credit that can give you rewards. #AskForbes
.@3countylaugh 1. Fraud protection. If your debit card is stolen, you have to get your $ back. W/ a credit card, it's not your $ #AskForbes
.@3countylaugh There are 3 reasons you might want to use a credit card... #AskForbes
RT @3countylaugh: @Forbes @npclements @magnify_money #askforbes why use a credit card at all if you can afford to pay for everything you buâŚ
.@JCScruggs Otherwise, they will retroactively charge you the full 12 months of interest at the high 20% + rate #AskForbes
.@JCScruggs That means you if they give you 12 months at 0%, you have to pay the balance in full. #AskForbes
.@JCScruggs And most 0% offers on store cards charge retroactive interest. #AskForbes
.@JCScruggs Warning: Store cards are the MOST expensive type of credit out there. Interest rates can be 20% &amp; up #AskForbes
.@JCScruggs If you open a store credit card, it's like any other card. That means if you max it out, your score gets punished. #AskForbes
RT @JCScruggs: @Forbes how much of an impact does retail financing (i.e. engagement ring financing) affect my credit? #AskForbes
.@awesomepeter Rule 3. Pay on time every month. Automate it. Otherwise you can be penalized. At 60 days late, you lose the promo #AskForbes
.@awesomepeter Rule 2. Have a plan to pay off the debt during the transfer period. The rate goes up after the promotional period. #AskForbes
.@awesomepeter Rule 1. Never spend on the credit card when you do the transfer. #AskForbes
.@awesomepeter Balance transfers can be a great way to get out of debt, so long as you play by the rules. #AskForbes
RT @awesomepeter: @Forbes @npclements @magnify_money Are balance transfers a good idea to reduce your credit card debt? #AskForbes
.@janetnovack 2. If it was an old card, it can, over time, shorten the length of your credit file. #AskForbes
.@janetnovack 1. By eliminating available credit, it can increase your utilization. #AskForbes
.@janetnovack It can hurt your score in 2 ways... #AskForbes
.@janetnovack That way, you can keep it open without incurring any costs #AskForbes
.@janetnovack  If there is an annual fee, you should call the bank and ask them to migrate your fee card to a no fee card. #AskForbes
.@janetnovack It can. Generally you should keep cards open. #AskForbes
RT @janetnovack: #askforbes if you have 2 credit cards and cancel one (because you don't like that card), does that hurt your score?
.@SirLutherKing But if you don't trust yourself, just wait. You have your entire life ahead of you to build a credit score. #AskForbes
.@SirLutherKing I opened my first credit card my freshman year, and had a 700+ score when I graduated. #AskForbes
.@SirLutherKing Are you responsible &amp; do you have self-discipline? If the answer is yes, get one as soon as you're eligible. #AskForbes
RT @SirLutherKing: When do you suggest a college student who doesn't NEED a credit card to get one solely to build credit? #AskForbes
.@RealSQUEZZ You can then identify charges that weren't yours, &amp; you won't be liable. That's one of the benefits of a credit card #AskForbes
.@RealSQUEZZ  They will block the card to prevent future transactions and send you a new card. #AskForbes
.@RealSQUEZZ As soon as you realize your card is missing, immediately call the credit card company and report it. #AskForbes
RT @RealSQUEZZ: @Forbes HOW CAN I RECOVER MY CREDIT CARD, IF LOST OR STOLEN? #Askforbes
.@weirdlyenough Score treats people with maxed out credit cards as lacking discipline #AskForbes
.@weirdlyenough 1 BIG warning - if you spend until your limit, you're maxing out your card. That will hurt your credit score. #AskForbes
.@weirdlyenough But, if that describes you, it could be helpful #AskForbes
.@weirdlyenough If you spend until your card is declined, I would question whether you should have a card to begin with #AskForbes
.@weirdlyenough That's a personal question! #AskForbes
RT @weirdlyenough: @Forbes Will setting a lower credit limit help in credit card spending discipline? #AskForbes
.@ivantigro74 So, it should not impact your score, at least. #AskForbes
.@ivantigro74 Typically, credit cards do not report missed payments to the credit bureau until they are 30 days or more past due. #AskForbes
.@ivantigro74 If you are, call &amp; ask them to waive the fee. Often credit card companies will if you just missed the cutoff #AskForbes
.@ivantigro74 If the payment arrived 1 day late, you may be charged a late fee by your credit card company. #AskForbes
RT @ivantigro74: @npclements #AskForbes hey guys. Last month for the first time my cc paymnt cleared a day after its due date, will that afâŚ
.@thisisKristine If your statement balance = 0, it is as if you aren't using your card #AskForbes
To have the best score, your utilization should be low &amp; your payments on time. #AskForbes
.@thisisKristine Wait for the statement to come, and then pay the balance in full #AskForbes
.@thisisKristine You want to have some activity (best to be below 20% of available credit). #AskForbes
.@thisisKristine If you do that, the statement balance will appear at "0" on your credit report. #AskForbes
.@thisisKristine If you want to build your credit score, you don't want to pay before your bill is due. #AskForbes

.@Hulk009 Automate the billing to your credit card, automate the monthly payment, then never carry the credit card with you. #AskForbes
If you don't trust yourself with a credit card, don't carry it with you. Just set up 1 single bill each month #AskForbes
.@Hulk009 And then the "min due" makes the problem "go away." But it doesn't. #AskForbes
.@Hulk009 Credit cards are built to tempt you. It is incredibly easy to spend money you don't have to buy things you don't need. #AskForbes
