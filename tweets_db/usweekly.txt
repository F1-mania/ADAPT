Miley Cyrus is hosting the MTV #VMAs! http://t.co/CwIsakG0Vs http://t.co/q0SdGKxnZO
Kaitlyn gets an island! Nick grows a beard! Kaitlyn cries, and Shawn still calls Nick "the other guy." Watch with me! #thebachelorette
Next week! "The unforgettable season finale of #thebachelorette!" And a special treat for @jenniferweiner readers! (That's me). #MenTellAll
Kaitlyn's got two great guys. "You've owned everything you've done." And, Lord, #thebachelorette has made her pay. #MenTellAll
I feel this show might have been funnier with more of Tony the Healer camera-time. #MenTellAll
"Does Chris Harrison live in a palace? Ever since he wrote a book..." So books = palace? Oh, @amyschumer. You are funny! #MenTellAll
Blooper time! Joe sneaks off for a woodsy Irish wee. Oh, and Kaitlyn hates birds! #MenTellAll
Ian gave Kaitlyn notes every week? Why didn't we know that? Oh, right. Because he got the villain edit. #MenTellAll
Ryan's changed his hair, and gives Kaitlyn a rose. Hey, remember when he asked a guy "Why am I not raping you right now?" #MenTellAll
Women are objects, without agency, existing for men to choose between. Then, when they act on their desire, they get shamed. #MenTellAll
Remember: this show began pitting two women against each other, letting men vote like chicken vs steak at a wedding dinner. #MenTellAll
Guys now hassling Kaitlyn about bringing Nick on the show. Didn't we already have an entire show about that? #MenTellAll
Jonathan is miffed that Kaitlyn said her husband was in the room. Kaitlyn reminds Jonathan that he voted for Britt. Where's she? #MenTellAll
I think #thebachelorette is trying to have its sexycake and eat its finger-wagging moralizing too. But what say you?
And, of course, if a Bachelor samples all three flavors in the Fantasy Suites, that's a-okay. Was this so different? #thebachelorette
If Kaitlyn had waited 'til the Fantasy Suites? Nary a word. If a Bachelor had slipped into a lady's...room? Nothing. #mentellall
Kaitlyn slept with Nick. Producers made her discuss it/apologize for it over and over. They can't be shocked at the blowback. #MenTellAll
"You're a little whore...so shut your little whore mouth." So, yes, anonymous people will be monstrous on the Internet. #MenTellAll
"Spreading hate is not okay," Kaitlyn says. I will not joke about how spreading other things is fine. I WILL NOT. I REFUSE. #MenTellAll
"This show...continually pushes the boundaries." Appropriate behavior. Gender roles. Scrotums hanging out of sumo diapers. #MenTellAll
Commercials! Don't forget, I will be on @GMA tomorrow morning, talking about the hot steamy juicy mess that is #MenTellAll.
So, wait, if Ben H. had gotten the big bed in Austin and Shawn had been in the cot, this all could have been different? #MenTellAll
Ben H. and Kaitlyn were totes in love. "She said it first!" Eh. I've said things I didn't mean when I was hungry. It happens. #MenTellAll
"Something was said that night," says Ben H.. Will we FINALLY get some details on Kaitlyn's Austin Sneak-down? #MenTellAll
#MenTellAll audience -- did they hand out flat-irons at the door? It's a lot of straight hair in that audience. And not many men.
"So you're not over her." @chrisbharrison demands. Does he need man-tears to keep his skin youthful and dewy? #MenTellAll
"You loved this girl, didn't you?" Harrison barks. He's gonna make someone cry. Ben Z.. Jared. Someone. #MenTellAll
Jared's departure goes down as the hands-down classiest #bachelor/ette exit in the franchise history. #MenTellAll
Guys. Jared is so sweet, I just want to take him home and feed him that puppy chow that makes its own gravy. #MenTellAll
My sweetie Jared is up next. Meanwhile, are you wondering who the H @jenniferweiner is? I write books! Here is some! https://t.co/qJuLYB30dT
"Have you cried since?" asks Harrison, who is DETERMINED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. Ben Z. hangs tough. He's dry. #MenTellAll
"So what do you think happen?" probes @chrisbharrison. The wake date was weird and she liked other guys more? Done. Snack time! #MenTellAll
Oh, right, Ben Z.'s whole tear-constipation issue. Will Kaitlyn be his emotional Metamucil? #MenTellAll
Here is Ben! He is a strapping hunk of man-meat! But also with a sad story! Hot and sad -- a delectable combination! #MenTellAll
"The most talked-about bachelorette of all time." My God. It's like Kaitlyn had sex, then ate the man she had sex with! #thebachelorette
"There was no placation," insists JJ. I once took a placation, where I stayed home pretending I had time off. #thebachelorette
"Clint Arlis? Clint Nasty!" #thebachelorette
"The way I behaved with Clint? Someone needed to slap me in the face." -- JJ, trying to explain perplexing Clint-rage on #thebachelorette
First in the hot seat? It's @jjhlane. Highlights of the JJ/Clint bromance: zit squeezing. Hot tubbing. Odd hostility. #thebachelorette
Kaitlyn on blast for saying "I see my husband in this room." Maybe someone was holding a picture of Nick? #thebachelorette
Kupah's tie is...around his neck? Underneath his shirt? I'm confused. Might need to lie down. #thebachelorette
"She owes it to herself to flip every stone," says JJ. And to smooch every slimy worm she finds beneath them. #thebachelorette
Kupah is angry that Nick weaseled his way onto the show. Just as Kupah blustered his way off! #thebachelorette
"We were intellectually curious," says Clint. We all remember that time in band camp that we were intellectually curious. #thebachelorette
"The stuff that we talked about in the 'hot tub,'" JJ begins. "Why does everything have air quotes?" inquires Harrison. #thebachelorette
OMG. Clint and JJ both have beards! CONTROVERSIAL! #thebachelorette
You know you've had a bad season on #thebachelorette when you need to start off with "first of all, I am a straight man."
Soon Kaitlyn will be out to address "the national controversy." I mean. She's not Donald Trump. #thebachelorette
"That's not a representation of who I am," says Ian. I don't know. When you have to *say* it's a "heartfelt apology..." #thebachelorette
Ian takes off his jacket. Falls to his knees. Gives wooden apology. He's sorry for Kaitlyn's mother. Are we buying this? #TheBachelorette
"No slouches on this stage," says Corey. As Ryan edges off the stage. #thebachelorette
"It looks like Princeton needs to teach a class to how to not be an a**hole." I TOTALLY TOOK THAT CLASS! #thebachelorette
"I'm being punished for being an intellectual." Hey, Ian, which one of us live-tweeted this entire season? #thebachelorette
Loving JJ's sneer about Ian sitting in his room "reading books." Ew. #thebachelorette
Let's be real: "Villains gotta vill" was not a bad catchphrase. #thebachelorette
Whoa. Cliff's grown a Brokeback Beard. JJ's sock game is strong. Hey, remember when Ryan M. was all horned up? #thebachelorette
And it's the return of Joe's Left Nut on "bleachable moments." Like Left Shark, only scrotal. #thebachelorette
Commercials! My issue with "Bachelors in Paradise" is I hate to sweat so much I don't even like seeing other people do it. #thebachelorette
"A second...or even third chance at love," smirks Harrison, who convinced producers to send him to Mexico, except with a/c. #thebachelorette
Just for fun, let's drink -- or eat! -- whenever @chrisbharrison says "controversy." 2x if he's got a straight face. #thebachelorette
"Men Tell All" timeI am @jenniferweiner, neither a former cast member nor celebrity...but I write books and I love #thebachelorette!
Will this be #TheBachelorette's most dramatic. #MenTellAll. Ever?!? @JenniferWeiner is live tweeting in 5 minutes -- #watchwithus!

Thanks for tweeting #TheBachelorette with me tonight. If you enjoyed the tweets, follow me @possessionista
@Nialler_Harryxo yes.
The guys care so much. Kaitlyn cares so much. The families care so much. But I'm kinda eh... #TheBachelorette
New show: Everybody Loves Kaitlyn. #TheBachelorette
Shawn should have his dad tell Nick off. #TheBachelorette
Shawn's dad is not here to make friends. #TheBachelorette
I was hoping all of Shawn's family was going to be wearing crop tops. #TheBachelorette
Sisters are Kaitlyn's jam; Mine, I think is strawberry. #TheBachelorette
RT @JaclynSwartz: If I could rent castles for dudes on our 3rd date I'd be killin it #Bachelorette
@ryanhoover @veronicaromm Yeah, but you got it.
Whether she picks you or not, can we go to lunch with your mom @NickViall1? #TheBachelorette
Bella Viall for the next #BAchelorette!!!!! #Thebachelorette
"This is my brother Darryl. And this is my other brother Darryl." -Nick #TheBachelorette
@Linkus717 She is.
They  should lock Shawn and Nick in a closet listening to the HamsterDance until they bond like in a sorority #TheBachelorette
Ben deserves better than a minivan, ABC. #TheBachelorette
"Guess I shouldn't have put her bra in the freezer." #TheBachelorette #Notthebestsleepoverever
Kaitlyn chooses Shawn ensuring that she'll never get to order room service breakfast as long as they're together. #TheBachelorette
The last thing Kaitlyn wants is to hurt one of these guys. The last thing I want is to wear Spanx on national television. #TheBachelorette
@kels_pardue Come back to life; we need the followers.
If I were Kaitlyn, I'd keep Ben around solely for what he could do for my sweater collection #TheBachelorette
Kaitlyn's double stick tape should win the award for Best Supporting Role in a Rose Ceremony #TheBachelorette
They should have had Boyz II Men playing music at this rose ceremony. #SoHardToSayGoodbye #TheBachelorette
It's me! @Possessionista  https://t.co/9Iez15sUxL
Nick brings out a deep conversation in me. And Ben is so fun. But Shawn looks great in Spanx. #TheBachelorette
Nick's like, "Sorry Shawn is so jealous of me, but I can't help it that I'm so popular." #TheBachelorette
RT @AmyUlness: @usweekly Kaitlyn: How terrible it would be if Shawn was the kind of husband who would get all mad when I have sex with otheâŚ
Shawn is officially a morning after pill. #TheBachelorette
Talking about Nick seems like the worst way to spend your off-camera time, Kaitlyn. #TheBachelorette
Shawn says Nick is acting like a 16-year-old girl. Just wait til he finds out about Ben's #BestSleepoverEver #TheBachelorette
He is a terrible person. He is delusional. HE DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE! #TheBachelorette
@SdBWorking Men in Spanx.
The last thing Kaitlyn wants to do is talk to Shawn about Nick, so naturally she talks to Shawn about Nick. #TheBachelorette
By far the most embarrassing thing to ever happen on #TheBachelorette: The time the hot trainer was caught wearing Spanx.
Golf is like love because you can do it until you're old and gray. Also, it's better without pants. -Shawn. #TheBachelorette
This is why ABC had to cancel Black Box. #TheBachelorette
Golf is a lot like love because it lasts until you're old and gray. Also, it's better as a foursome. #TheBachelorette
Ben H even makes the walk of shame look good. #TheBachelorette
What you didn't see: Ben and Kaitlyn playing light as a feather, stiff as a board. #BestSleepoverEVer #theBachelorette
If Kaitlyn falls asleep, will Ben put her bra in the freezer? #BestSleepoverEver #TheBachelorette
Over/Under if Ben draws a mustache on Kaitlyn once she falls asleep. #BestSleepoverEver #TheBachelorette
Dear @benhiggi: If it doesn't work out with @kaitlynbristowe we have an extra pair of fuzzy slippers for the second best sleepover ever
Instead of the hometowns, Kaitlyn should just give Shawn and Ben back the sumo suits. #TheBachelorette
#BestSleepoverEver
Just once I wish someone would call out @chrisbharrison for lack of creativity in his letter writing. #TheBachelorette
A great twist would be if Ben H turns out to be a decoy from To Catch a Predator. #TheBachelorette
RT if you hope @kaitlynbristowe sends Ben home (so we can have a chance with him) #TheBachelorette
Not the first time this season @kaitlynbristowe has felt like running from a pair of asses. #TheBachelorette
Whoever decided Kaitlyn should have to ride a horse before the fantasy suite is a sick, sick person. #TheBachelorette
Kaitlyn is excited to see @benhiggi today. The rest of us are excited to see him take his shirt off. #TheBachelorette
RT is you're hoping that this is the week that @NickViall1 and Shawn trade friendship bracelets. #TheBachelorette

Kaitlyn can drive stick? Plus 10. #TheBachelorette
This cry is laugh out loud funny #lovewins #TheBachelorette
How can you have an intimate relashe with someone named cupcake, cupcake #TheBachelorette
I brought you here on this 12 minute date to dump your sorry ass. #TheBachelorette
Was it my lack of gingivitis? - Cupcake #TheBachelorette
I haven't flossed for weeks. Cupcake and I would never work. #TheBachelorette
I don't shower when I don't like guys either #TheBachelorette
RT @jennaveronika: @usweekly hairs up, she's not that into cupcake
If Ben H. was 3 years older I would make him be my husband #creeper #TheBachelorette
I predict a quickie date for a quickie goodbye #TheBachelorette
RT @Possessionista: But seriously, I hope Nick is the next Bachelor. #TheBachelorette
You know Nick's in love because that ring is effing hideous #TheBachelorette
I like the change in format because no one wants to introduce dudes to their families unless you've spent the night #TheBachelorette
"We all screw up"...and screw #TheBachelorette
If Chris Harrison would just explain what episode this is world order could be restored #TheBachelorette
Cupcake has GOT to go. But nothing against cupcakes, I still want to eat them all the time. #TheBachelorette
I hate people who take pics of people sleeping with their mouths open #icatchflies #thebachelorette
Just me and my girlfriend....and 4 other guys! #TheBachelorette
@Aysun95353390 @viallnicholas28 if he doesn't win, me too! But I still have hope there is something w him and Kaitlyn
Ben Z. wants forever love which also comes in the form of 10 episodes with 25 new girls #TheBachelorette
My money was always on "Cupcake" to break down into female hysterics #TheBachelorette
Ben Z. is one of the few personal trainers I'd go to the gym for #thebachelorette
WHERE IS CHRIS HARRISON?! I'm so lost without him. #thebachelorette
I seriously can't figure out what episode this is. #TheBachelorette
@MissDanielleLea thanks gf! (@JaclynSwartz)
@KandKHoney @kaitlynbristowe @jimmykimmel right on
@ElaineMadelon either or!
Intimacy is never a mistake. Until you have to deal with the same conversation 48382901020494 times as a result. #TheBachelorette
If I initiated this many emotional talks in the real world I'd be single forever. #TheBachelorette
Would be fun to remind us which dudes who are left actually voted for Kaitlyn. #TheBachelorette
@JBossmin intimate make out? đ
Nick snorted wasabi before this chat #nocrying #thebachelorette
I think Nick learned his lesson the first time đ no more kissing and telling #TheBachelorette
Ben H. just upset Kaitlyn didn't join him in the shower #TheBachelorette
Kaitlyn's dress is her audition for dancing with the stars #TheBachelorette
This show causes you to go so crazy that the minute "mistake" gets thrown around everyone thinks they're it #TheBachelorette
The Ben's haven't said one word this week and I need some more reassurance. #TheBachelorette
@Aysun95353390 @PrincessProbz @JaclynSwartz why thank you
Shawn is sure that none of the other guys feel the same way as he does. And by that, he means an insecure annoying pansy. #TheBachelorette
Shawn is to reassurance as I am to red wine. Need more of it, all the time. #TheBachelorette
Do you think you'd be attracted to a grown man who goes by cupcake? Fat chance. #TheBachelorette
Imagine how much Botox you'd go through if you had Joe's forehead. #TheBachelorette
Shawn needs to grow a pair. #TheBachelorette
Hey Shawn you're not the bachelor. #TheBachelorette
I wish we were watching Tierra talk about her sparkle. This 2 on 1 was a let down. #TheBachelorette
If Shawn cried over not getting a rose, I can't WAIT to see what he does when he finds out about Nick. #TheBachelorette
@linablue not a bad guess! Though I would never help a competitor look better - ha!
Save the "I'm a cheater" talk for...never #TheBachelorette
You want to know what else Joe should put on the table? His accent. #TheBachelorette
JJ's teeth are white. That's a first. #TheBachelorette
Too bad Clint isn't on this date w JJ. #TheBachelorette
Gotta love when the sh*t talking gets caught on camera đ #thebest #thebachelorette
Also, if "slut shaming" wasn't the buzz word right now, Kaitlyn wouldn't be getting half the crap she is #TheBachelorette
Don't worry Kaitlyn, if Nick had actually kiss and told, Shawn would have had an aneurism already #TheBachelorette
The minute egos get bruised it's the "I want to eliminate myself" card #bachelorette
Shawn missed the memo on how this show works #needygirlfriend #bachelorette
Oh hey! It's me, @jaclynswartz, let's get ready to make fun of all things #Bachelorette
