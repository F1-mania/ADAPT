@litsakouzina We're working to restore relationships for all users. Direct messages are a good hint!
@hesperus Thanks for your patience! We'll keep you updated.
@dcrane2 We're working to restore what we can. We'll keep you updated here and at http://status.twitter.com
@capricornucopia See http://twitter.com/account/notifications to remove some of that noise.
@maxskybarger we sent you an email with a new password; you should be able to log in with your user name and the new password.
@mleis We're working to restore as much as possible. Thanks for your patience.
@jdblundell You can filter out all the noise by going here: http://twitter.com/account/notifications and setting the @replies option
@iJohn We miss it too. Now that we've strengthened the team by adding a bunch of search expertise, it'll be back, and better than ever!
@nazgul You can fix that by changing that setting though. You'll only get @replies directed to people you follow. http://tinyurl.com/29wnjw
@whitneyhess Username search still has some issues. Fortunately, we just added a bunch of search people to help us fix that! :)
@icedcoffee We're attempting just that! We'll keep everyone updated.
@roneyII Hm. Try changing your screen name to something like, "roney2" and then to "roneyii".
@nickswitzer Why, we at Twitter Inc. have that account!
@nazgul Go to http://twitter.com/account/notifications and choose to get @replies directed at people you follow. Cuts down on the noise.
@mitchellzwick Unfortunately, we have no concrete timeline. We're doing it as quickly as we can.
@mpodrazik Spam? You may turn of @replies directed to people you don't follow at http://twitter.com/account/notifications
@typeamom Indeed. We feel pretty terrible about it and are working hard to restore.
@Chakat_Streak We have a restore script running now. We'll keep everyone updated here and at http://status.twitter.com
@BrookeyT We're working on it! Apologies for the inconvenience.
@jgombala Not sure what you mean by that...
@ConstantineXVI We're working hard on restoring IM.  Pizza may help!
@Scytale Yes, we're aware this affects more than just the counts. We're working to restore the connections.
@onlyaman We feel bad about that. It was a database mishap 2 nights ago. We're working to restore.
@apollogonzales We've been updating our status blog at http://status.twitter.com. We'll keep that up to date with the freshest info.
@aaron_foley We had a database mishap 2 nights ago and are recovering. More information as we have it.
