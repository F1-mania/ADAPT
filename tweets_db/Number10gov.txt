https://t.co/KDxCw44yri
Read PM's speech on plans to help working families and extend opportunities to all in full: http://t.co/JmmW9xnlKr
PM: By taking on govt failure &amp; backing family, education &amp; work we extend opportunity &amp; could change the lives of many disadvantaged people
PM: We will help more people back into work and increase the minimum wage to £6.70 from October 2015.
PM: Next we need to improve ‘coasting schools’. We will turn around 1,000 more failing schools and improve hundreds more coasting schools.
PM: 117,000 families already turned around by the troubled families programme, 400,000 more families over next five years
PM: Families are the best welfare system there is. In the next 5 years we will double free childcare for 3 &amp; 4 yrs olds with working parents
PM: This is the change we need - to move from a low wage, high tax, high welfare society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society.
PM: The right track to extend opportunity is to recognise the causes of stalled social mobility and a lack of economic opportunity.
PM: Today I want to make a bigger, &amp; deeper, argument about how we realise the One Nation ideal &amp; help everyone achieve their full potential
PM: I want everyone in this country to have the opportunity to get on &amp; make a good life. That is the task for the next 5 years.
PM: Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever your background or stage of life I believe this govt can help you fulfil your aspirations.

PM: So on this historic day, let’s pledge to keep those principles alight. Let’s keep #MagnaCarta alive.
PM: Liberty, justice, democracy, the rule of law – we hold these things dear and  they took shape right here by the Thames. #MagnaCarta
PM: #MagnaCarta is something every person in Britain should be proud of. Its copies may be faded, but its principles shine as brightly.
PM: The seeds sown here have grown throughout the world. In America; in India with Gandhi and South Africa with Nelson Mandela. #MagnaCarta
PM: The clauses inspiring those who fought in the English Civil War, giving fuel to the Chartists, succour to the Suffragettes. #MagnaCarta
PM: This great charter shaped the world for the best part of a millennium helping to promote arguments for justice and freedom. #MagnaCarta
PM: What is taken for granted here in Britain, is what others are crying out for, hoping for, praying for. #MagnaCarta
PM: The countries that have these things tend to be the long term successes. Those who don’t tend to be the long term failures. #MagnaCarta
PM: All over the world, people are still struggling to live by the rule of law and to see their governments subject to that law. #MagnaCarta
PM: What happened here eight centuries ago is as relevant today as it was then. And that relevance extends far beyond Britain. #MagnaCarta
PM: The limits of executive power, guaranteed access to justice, the rule of law, shouldn’t be imprisonment without trial. #MagnaCarta
PM: 800 years ago, on this day, King John put his seal to a document that would change the world. #MagnaCarta
