HS: I intend to transfer resources from forces professional standards departments &amp; relevant areas so IPCC has budget &amp; manpower #police
HS:I will transfer responsibility for all serious &amp; sensitive allegations to IPCC #police
HS:Also want to ensure IPCC is equipped to do its important work. Public has concerns about its powers &amp; resources #police
HS:Leveson made several recommendations on @police transparency. We accept what has been recommended - ACPO will take forward relevant work
HS:@CollegeofPolicing will establish stronger #police vetting procedures to be considered during recruitment &amp; promotions
HS:Where misconduct is proven, these #police officers will also be struck off by @CollegeofPolicing
HS:If #police officer resigns or retires to avoid dismissal, hearings will be concluded regardless of their departure from the force
HS:To prevent #police who lose jobs for misconduct being recruited by other forces, a register of those struck off to be introduced
HS:@CollegeofPolice will publish new code of ethics for all #police &amp; create a single set of professional standards
HS:A register of chief officers’ pay, gifts, hospitality, outside interests, second jobs, &amp;media contact will be published online #police
HS:Many existing #police reforms address these challenges but we need further measures to root out corruption &amp; misconduct
HS:We must ensure officers who do wrong are investigated &amp; punished &amp; ensure organisations who #police the police are properly equipped
HS:We need #police to be more transparent; clearer rules on conduct We need to open top ranks so policing is less of a closed shop
HS:But we shouldn’t ignore that #police misconduct can undermine justice, let down majority &amp; damage public confidence
HS:I do not believe there is endemic corruption in #police, vast majority conduct themselves with highest standards of integrity
HS:But good work of thousands of #police is undermined when a minority behave inappropriately
HS:They’re cutting crime even as we reduce #police spending. Vast majority of officers work with a strong sense of fairness &amp; duty
Home Secretary:We’re lucky, in Britain, to have finest #police officers  in the world who put themselves in harm’s way to protect the public
We will be live tweeting the Home Secretary’s oral statement on police integrity – follow using #police

Home Secretary: We will work closely with the European Court of Human Rights to reduce unacceptable delays in extradition system.
Extradition: Representations on human rights grounds should, in future, be considered by the High Court rather than the Home Secretary
Home Office accepts Baker Review’s recommendations that a prima facie evidence test should not be reintroduced.
Home Secretary: UK/US Extradition Treaty “brings benefits to both of our countries”.
Extradition: Forum Bar will enable British courts to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice
Home Secretary: After careful consideration I have concluded that Mr McKinnon’s extradition would be incompatible with his human rights
